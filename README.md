# Captivio Interview Task

Using the play framework 2.2.x we would like you develop a simple web application which will present the user a simple contact us form, as follows: -

* Name :
* Email :
* Address :
* Message :
* Submit Button

## Essential Requirements

1. Once the form is submitted am email with the details captured from the form is sent to [info@captiv.io](mailto:info@captiv.io)
2. User is presented with a confirmation message that the form was submitted successfully.
3. Push project to publicly viewable Bitbucket or Github account and send the link to the project to [info@captiv.io](mailto:info@captiv.io) no later than 6pm Sunday the 10th of May.

## Nice to Have

1. Form validation -- guard against null or empty string values
2. Email validation -- is the content entered in the email field a valid email address from a syntax perspective.
3. CCS styling of the form -- preferably using Twitter Bootstrap.
4. Any other additional validation that you deem appropriate.
